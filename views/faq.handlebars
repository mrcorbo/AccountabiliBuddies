        <p class="h5"id="FAQ-text"><u> 1. What is AccountabiliBuddies?</u></p>
        <p><em>AccountabiliBuddies is an online space for individuals to semi-anonymously connect with others working towards a common goal. We strive to create a safe environment which encourages support and camaraderie amongst individuals seeking to eliminate harmful habits and/or hold themselves accountable to accomplish their goals.</em></p>
        <p class="h5"id="FAQ-text"><u> 2. Why choose AccountabiliBuddies? </u></p>
        <p><em>We’re glad you asked! A huge part of why eliminating habits/breaking routines can be so difficult is the overwhelming feelings of isolation. Your mind taunts you with thoughts like, “I must be the only person that feels this way”, “I feel terrible knowing that nobody else is struggling in the same ways that I am”, or even “I wish I had someone to talk to about my journey”. With AccountabiliBuddies, we have created a judgement-free, semi-anonymous environment that encourages “buddies” to support one another through their journeys. At ACB, you no longer have to fear the feelings of isolation that accompany abrupt change. </em></p>

        <p class="h5" id="FAQ-text"><u> 3. How do I earn trophies?</u></p>
        <p><em>Trophies are earned by accomplishing tasks related to your personal goals. Logging your successes daily is the foundation for earning trophies, but even engaging with the online community can earn you an achievement! Once earned, the trophies are proudly displayed on the user’s profile.</em></p>

        <p class="h5" id="FAQ-text"><u> 4. Is participation in public forums a requirement?</u></p>
        <p><em> Absolutely not! The forums exist for users seeking connections with indivudals who have similar goals. You are absolutely allowed to use AccountabiliBuddies on a solitary basis.</em></p>

        <p class="h5"id="FAQ-text"><u> 5. Are there consequences for not succeeding with your goals?</u></p>
        <p><em>The only consequence you face by not holding yourself accountable is living with the realization that change has not been achieved. We understand that change is a gradual process, and sometimes we have to fall down a few times before we are able to pick ourselves up. You will not be punished for not meeting the requirements of your goals, and AccountabiliBuddies will be here each and every time you decide to try again. </em></p>
